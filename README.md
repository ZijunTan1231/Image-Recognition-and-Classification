# Image-Recognition-and-Classification

School Project

• Conducted preprocessing of image data, including data cleaning, standardization, and data augmentation, to enhance model accuracy and generalization.

• Utilized convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained models and transfer learning techniques (ResNet, Inception, and VGG) to predict two-level hierarchical classification. Achieved accuracy rates of 90% and 86%.
